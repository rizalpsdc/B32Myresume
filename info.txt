overview
Hydrogen combustion engines work similarly to traditional gasoline engines but burn hydrogen instead of petrol. 
This process produces water vapor as the primary emission, making it much cleaner than fossil fuels. Kawasaki, 
for example, is developing a hydrogen-powered motorcycle based on their Ninja H2 model. 
This bike uses a supercharged engine modified for direct hydrogen fuel injection, 
which helps maximize power output while minimizing emissions

scope
1. Technological Development
Fuel Cell Integration: Developing efficient and compact hydrogen fuel cells that can fit within the limited space of a motorcycle frame. This includes designing fuel cell stacks and integrating them with electric motors1.
Hydrogen Storage: Creating safe and efficient hydrogen storage solutions that can be easily refueled and provide sufficient range for practical use1.
2. Infrastructure and Refueling
Refueling Stations: Establishing a network of hydrogen refueling stations to support the widespread adoption of hydrogen motorcycles. This is crucial for the practical use of these vehicles1.
Hydrogen Production: Ensuring that hydrogen is produced in an environmentally friendly manner, such as through electrolysis using renewable energy sources1.
3. Research and Testing
Prototype Development: Building and testing prototypes to evaluate performance, safety, and efficiency. This includes both laboratory testing and real-world trials23.
Open-Source Platforms: Some projects, like those at MIT, are developing open-source platforms to allow other researchers and developers to test and improve hydrogen motorcycle technology2.

Time line
This project will take around 7 months below the details of the work distribution

1. Design and Engineering
Mechanical Design: Engineers focus on designing the bike's frame, integrating the hydrogen fuel cell or combustion engine, and ensuring all components fit within the limited space of a motorcycle12.
Electrical Systems: This includes designing the electrical architecture, integrating the fuel cell with the electric motor, and ensuring efficient power management1.
2. Hydrogen Storage and Fuel Systems
Storage Solutions: Developing safe and efficient hydrogen storage systems that can withstand high pressures and fit within the motorcycle's frame2.
Fuel Delivery: Designing the fuel delivery system to ensure a consistent and safe supply of hydrogen to the engine or fuel cell3.
3. Prototyping and Testing
Prototype Development: Building initial prototypes to test the integration of all systems. This includes both bench testing and real-world trials1.
Performance Testing: Conducting tests to evaluate the bike's performance, efficiency, and safety under various conditions1.
4. Safety and Compliance
Safety Protocols: Ensuring all safety standards are met, including handling and storage of hydrogen, and designing safety features to protect riders1.
Regulatory Compliance: Working to meet all regulatory requirements for road use, including emissions standards and vehicle safety regulations2.

The action Attribute
The action attribute in the <form> tag specifies where to send the form data when the form is submitted. 
This URL can be an absolute URL (pointing to a different website) or a relative URL 
(pointing to a file within the same website).

get method
GET Method
Data in URL: Form data is appended to the URL in name/value pairs. This means the data is visible in the browser's address bar.
<form action="/submit_form.php" method="get">
  <!-- form elements here -->
</form>
Length Limit: There is a limit to the amount of data that can be sent because URLs have a length restriction (usually around 2048 characters).
Caching: Requests can be cached by the browser, which can be useful for repeated requests.
Bookmarking: URLs with parameters can be bookmarked, making it easy to revisit the same query.
Security: Less secure for sensitive data (like passwords) because the data is visible in the URL.

post method
Data in Body: Form data is sent in the body of the HTTP request, not in the URL. This makes it invisible in the browser's address bar.
<form action="/submit_form.php" method="post">
  <!-- form elements here -->
</form>
No Length Limit: There is no limit to the amount of data that can be sent, making it suitable for large amounts of data.
Caching: Requests are not cached by default, which is useful for operations that should not be repeated (like submitting a form).
Bookmarking: Cannot be bookmarked since the data is not in the URL.
Security: More secure for sensitive data because the data is not exposed in the URL. However, it should still be sent over HTTPS to ensure encryption.

when need to use get and post

Use GET: When you need to retrieve data without causing any side effects, like searching or filtering data.
Use POST: When you need to send data that will change the server state, like submitting a form, uploading a file,
or sending sensitive information.
